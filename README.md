  My CV and Cover Letter created with LaTeX
</h1>

This is a LaTeX template for your outstanding job application, inspired by [**Awesome CV**](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV)

## What is Awesome CV?
**Awesome CV** is LaTeX template for a **CV(Curriculum Vitae)**, **Résumé** or **Cover Letter** inspired by [Fancy CV](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/cv-or-resume/fancy-cv). It is easy to customize your own template, especially since it is really written by a clean, semantic markup.

## Quick Start
* [**Edit Résumé on OverLeaf.com**](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/awesome-cv/tvmzpvdjfqxp)
* [**Edit Cover Letter on OverLeaf.com**](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/awesome-cv-cover-letter/pfzzjspkthbk)

#### Requirements
A full TeX distribution is assumed.  [Various distributions for different operating systems (Windows, Mac, \*nix) are available](http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/55437) but TeX Live is recommended.
You can [install TeX from upstream](https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/1092) (recommended; most up-to-date) or use `sudo apt-get install texlive-full` if you really want that.  (It's generally a few years behind.)

If you don't want to install the dependencies on your system, this can also be obtained via [Docker](https://docker.com).

#### Usage
At a command prompt, run

```bash
xelatex {your-cv}.tex
```

Or using docker:

```bash
docker run --rm --user $(id -u):$(id -g) -i -w "/doc" -v "$PWD":/doc thomasweise/texlive make
```

In either case, this should result in the creation of ``{your-cv}.pdf``
