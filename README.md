# My Personal Cirriculum Vitae

I use the template provided by [@posquit0](https://github.com/posquit0).

I leave the banner in this README as a hyperlink to the original template for anyone who wants to fork:

## How to Use

#### Requirements

A full TeX distribution is assumed.  [Various distributions for different operating systems (Windows, Mac, \*nix) are available](http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/55437) but TeX Live is recommended.
You can [install TeX from upstream](https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/1092) (recommended; most up-to-date) or use `sudo apt-get install texlive-full` if you really want that.  (It's generally a few years behind.)

If you don't want to install the dependencies on your system, this can also be obtained via [Docker](https://docker.com).

#### Usage

At a command prompt, run

```bash
xelatex {your-cv}.tex
```

Or using docker:

```bash
docker run --rm --user $(id -u):$(id -g) -i -w "/doc" -v "$PWD":/doc thomasweise/texlive make
```

In either case, this should result in the creation of ``{your-cv}.pdf``
