  \lettersection{About Me}
After completing my civil service duty, I moved from Bochum to the Netherlands to study medical biology in Nijmegen. 
I completed my bachelor’s degree and began my master's in medical epigenomics at the Radboud University. 
During this time, both in- and outside of university, I focused on developing IT skills such as setting up and managing headless Linux systems, programming with a focus on bioinformatics, machine learning and web-development. 
I honed my data-analysis skills during my master's internships in the Radboud UMC human genetics department, as well as in the comparative genomics group. 
Due to financial and personal reasons, I got stuck in a logistics job for many years and did not finish my masters.
A year ago I quit my logistics job to focus on extending my tech skills and to find a job which aligns with my passion for IT as well my education.
Apart from my professional goals, I enjoy going to concerts, bouldering, brewing kombucha and most importantly, spending time with my friends and family.
\lettersection{Why Software Development @ fuseki}
As a software developer at fuseki, I could work with a modern and diverse tech stack within a domain I am passionate about – data, data-driven insights and applications. 
Given fuseki has clients in the DAX40 speaks volumes about the company's quality, reliability, and in-depth knowledge within the domain.
With more than two decades of experience in the industry, I am sure fuseki has plenty of interesting and challenging tasks to be tackled and to learn from.
Furthermore, I like that you put emphasis on interdisciplinary teams and flat hierarchies as it facilities exchange of knowledge and ideas. 
As a trained biologist with focus on bioinformatics, data-analysis who is keen on web-development, machine learning and big-data, I would gladly join your team at and find a place at fuseki.
\lettersection{Why Me?}
While my career path may not have been straightforward, I have gained a lot of experience along the way, making me the ideal candidate for this position.
I'm not just excited about working as a software developer, but I am also tech-savvy with hands-on experience in web development as well as data analysis and with an interest in machine learning and data - be it big or small. 
Your tech-stack and mission align perfectly with my skills and interests, making it a great foundation to build on.
During my academic journey, I developed a passion for working with large amount of biological data, its analysis, machine learning and the associated technical and computational aspects.
To this end, I dedicated significant time to discover, learn or even develop the tools essential to achieve my goals.
Withing the domain of data-analysis, I became proficient in programming/scripting languages such as R, Python, Bash and command line operations.
When it comes to web-development skills I started using Java and JavaScript, utilizing frameworks like Spring as well as React and Next.js.
Working on projects like a workout tracker using Java and JavaScript, an R package to streamline data analysis during an internship, data analysis in Python, online courses, and providing technical support to friends and peers has given me ample experience in software development and troubleshooting complex issues.
I am intrinsically motivated to learn and eager to apply and share the skills showcased in the CV. 
While I value being able to work independently, I also appreciate having knowledgeable peers around to discuss stubborn problems. 
As a hands-on and down-to-earth person, as well as a hard worker, I would be pleased to meet with you soon.
