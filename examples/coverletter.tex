\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
After my civil service duty, I moved from Germany to the Netherlands in order to study medical biology in Nijmegen. 
After finishing my bachelor studies, I started my masters in medical biology.
For financial and personal reasons, I could not finish my master studies with diploma.
However, I finished the mandatory two internships - during which I taught myself bioinformatics - and the bulk of the courses.
I started working in logistics to finance myself and my studies.
What supposed to be a temporary solution to my financial situation turned out to be detrimental to the remainder of my study and to be a longer endeavor - lasting 4 years.
Although having a lot of really nice colleagues and superiors, which value me as a person and employee, I want a change in my life and start following my passion again.
I want to work in a field that I am deeply interested in and which is more meaningful to me than logistics.

\lettersection{Why GenomeScan?}
GenomeScan is on the intersection between biology and technology - fields I want to work in.
The pandemic and especially the incorrectly diagnosed and treated cancer my dad recently succumbed to, motivates me to want to contribute to cutting edge research and diagnostics at GenomeScan.
I believe at GenomeScan, I can put this motivation to use, expand my knowledge and learn from professionals about the latest NGS technologies, data analysis and processing pipelines.
I'd like to be involved in the development of software, enabling your company to deliver high quality and meaningful results to your customers in diagnostics and research.
Given GenomeScan's ISO certificates, received funds and research projects it is involved in, I have no doubt to be at the right place.
I like to work independently, but to have experts around that are open to questions, suggestions and like to discuss.
To me it is important to communicate with colleagues and especially superiors in an informal but respectful manner.
GenomeScan being a certified Great Place To Work, ticks all of those boxes.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I believe I am the ideal candidate for this job, because not only do I have proven technical skills to perform and analyze complex omics data, but also because of my strong personal motivation.
I have experience in communicating bioinformatical methods and results to researchers with and without bioinformatic background.
I am eager to learn and I am proud of my autodidacticism which allowed me develop most of the skills presented in my CV.
Working in logistics taught me to focus on customer demands and to handle tight timelines.
I don't like idling, I am a hands-on and down to earth person as well as a hard worker.
I'd be pleased if you consider my application.
