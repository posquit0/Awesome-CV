moderncv -- a modern curriculum vitae class

Moderncv provides a documentclass for typesetting curriculum vitaes in various
styles. It aims to be both straightforward to use and customizable, providing
four ready-made styles (classic, casual, banking and oldstyle) and allows you to
define your own style by easily modifying colors, fonts, etc.

Most commands are defined in such a way that arguments are optional.

Until a decent manual is written, you can always look in the "examples"
directory for some examples. Documents can be compiled into dvi, ps or pdf.
